This application is a bridge between Magento & Checkout POS. Currently it's to enable real-time 
inventory syncing from Checkout POS to Magento. This application uses the magja library which is a java/magento
API bridge.

The way it works is that using PostgreSQL notifications the Java Application (checkout-listener) sits and waits
for product change notifications. When a notification is heard, the listener will InventoryAdapter will fire and
run through it's process to see which items have changed & sync with Magento API.

This application is in alpha state.

TODO
