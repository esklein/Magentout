This application is a bridge between Magento & Checkout POS. Currently it's to enable real-time 
inventory syncing from Checkout POS to Magento. This application uses the magja library which is a java/magento
API bridge.

The way it works is that using PostgreSQL notifications the Java Application (checkout-listener) sits and waits
for product change notifications. When a notification is heard, the listener will InventoryAdapter will fire and
run through it's process to see which items have changed & sync with Magento API.

This application is in alpha state.

Setup Instructions 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install Checkout http://checkoutapp.com/
2. Install Magento from branch which I've forked (https://github.com/esklein/magento) - This contains API extensions which are needed.
3. Checkout this project (magentout) & (magja) - both exist on my github.
4. Run Checkout - Connect to local PostgreSQL instance and determine the database name which was created by Checkout
5. Run DBScript.sql script in the postgres instance against the checkout DB.
6. Modify ConnectionManager.java in this project specifying database name / host information.
7. Open magentout/magja in eclipse - Run 'CheckoutLsitener.java'. Watch as you add/update products in Checkout, they'll update in Magento.
